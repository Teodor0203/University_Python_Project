# Univeristy Python Project (1st Semester)

This was my first project, a simple Hangman game developed with **Pygame**, in collaboration with a few classmates. It helped me discover the world of programming and sparked my passion for it.
Through this project, I learned how to use **OOP**, **for** and **while** **loops**, **dictionaries**, **lists**, and **if** **conditions**.
